# Chase the Ace Web Game

This project implements a simple "Chase the Ace" card game in a web browser.  The game displays four cards face down.  The user interacts with the cards (although the interaction mechanics are not yet implemented in this version).

## Features

* Displays four playing cards face down using images.
* Uses a card-stack structure to visually represent the cards.
* Basic HTML structure for the game interface.
* JavaScript code to dynamically create and render the cards.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:  `git clone https://github.com/ahitagnied/chace.git`
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. No other installation steps are required, as the game runs directly in the browser.  You will need a web browser to run it.


## Technologies Used

* **HTML:**  Used for structuring the game's user interface.
* **CSS:** (implicitly used, though no CSS file is included in the given codebase)  Will be used for styling the game's visual appearance.
* **JavaScript:** Used for dynamically creating the cards and managing game logic (currently only card creation is implemented).


## Dependencies

This project has no external dependencies beyond standard web browser support for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
